## Real Good Food

Delicious, homemade baked goods using all natural, biological where possible ingredients.

### Who Am I

An Australian living in The Netherlands, I previously ran Pop-Up Nairobi in Kenya. 
This included:
- A cafe, Nook Kenya
- Cooking Classes
- Consulting with restaurants 
- Menu creation and training for high end safari lodges

I love baking, and Dutch Appeltart is of course delicious. Instead of competing with Dutch classics I offer my own style baked goods, homely, moist, moorish, like an Aussie grandma would make but with contemporary flavours.
