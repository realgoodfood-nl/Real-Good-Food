An Australian, baking in The Netherlands. Whilst I could never compete with the Dutch Appeltaart or amandelkoekjes I do offer moist, flavourful baking like Nanna use to make, with contemporary flavours and styles. 

*Chocolate Brownies with Chocolate Ganache*
  - or Mexican Style with added chili and cinnamon
  
*Apple Crumble Cheesecake*
  - Made with a speculaas base
  - Drizzled with salted caramel
  
*A multitude of cupcake flavours, if you can dream it, I can bake it*
  - Lemon and Passionfruit Cupcake, with a Lemon and Passionfruit Curd Core and Topping
  - Raspberry Cupcake with a Raspberry Cheesecake core and frosting
  - Coffee and Walnut Cupcake with Chocolate Ganache
  - Cinnamon Choc-Chip Cupcake with Chocolate Ganache
  - *or that one time I made a blue cheese cupcake, with Avocado frosting and caramalised bacon chips*
  
 *Australian Classics*
 
  - Lamingtons
  - Anzac Biscuits (koekjes)
  - Pavlova (*or is it from New Zealand...*)
